1) SPA -> 
Single page application is a Web application that changes and updates their content dynamically without refreshing the entire page. 

2) React and its Working -> 
React is a javascript library that is used to build User Interface(UI).
React works based on a component based architecture where UI is broken down into reusable components. React uses a virtual DOM a abstract in-memory representation of the real DOM to efficiently manage updates. When a component's state or props changes react updates the virtual DOM first compares it with the previous version using a diffing algorithm and then applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM it called reconcilation.

3) Difference bBetween SPA and MPA->
SPA:
Loads a single HTML page and updates content dynamically without reloading.
Uses client-side routing.
Provides a smooth, app-like user experience.
Built using front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.
Better for highly interactive apps like facebook, insta.

MPA:
Loads a new HTML page from the server for each user action.
Slower navigation due to full page reloads.
Uses server-side routing.
More traditional, website-like navigation.
Built using server-side languages (e.g., PHP, ASP.NET, JSP).

4) Pros & Cons of Single-Page Application (SPA)->
Pros:
Fast and Smooth Navigation
Improved User Experience
Efficient Data Handling
Reusable Components
Cons:
Harder for search engines to index without extra setup.
Initial Load TimeNeeds manual handling of navigation and history.

5) Explain about React->
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces to build single-page application. It allows to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the view when data changes. React follows a component-based architecture and uses a virtual DOM for fast and efficient rendering. It supports both class-based and functional components.

6) Virtual DOM
The Virtual DOM is a abstracted version of the real DOM used by React to improve performance. When the state of a component changes react:
Updates the virtual DOM.
Compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one using a diffing algorithm.
Identifies the minimal changes required.
Applies only those changes to the real DOM.

7) Features of React
Component-Based: UI is broken into reusable components.
Virtual DOM: Boosts performance by reducing direct DOM manipulation.
JSX: Allows writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows from parent to child using props.
Hooks (Functional Enhancements): Enables state and lifecycle features in functional components (e.g., useState, useEffect).
Performance Optimizations: React optimizes rendering using diffing and reconciliation.
